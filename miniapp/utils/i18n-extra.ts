/**
 * Mini-program-local translation extras.
 *
 * The auto-synced `i18n-catalog.ts` only contains keys that web's source
 * tree marks for translation via lingui (`<Trans>` / `t\`...\``). Strings
 * unique to the mini program — login copy, switch-account modal,
 * tap-to-copy-URL hints, etc. — never get extracted on the web side and
 * therefore have no translations even though they're called via `t()`.
 *
 * Rather than hack the web catalog (which lingui-extract would clobber
 * on the next run) or hardcode locale switches throughout, we put them
 * here. `t()` in `i18n.ts` checks this map first, then falls through to
 * the auto-synced catalog, then falls back to the English key. So
 * lingui-driven strings stay single-sourced in web/, and mini-only
 * strings stay single-sourced here.
 *
 * Add a key only when:
 *   1. The string is genuinely mini-program-only (no equivalent on web)
 *   2. The key isn't already in `web/src/locales/zh/messages.po`
 *
 * Otherwise add the string to web's <Trans> usage and let the i18n
 * workflow translate it on the next run.
 *
 * The per-locale entries are split into per-section objects merged via
 * spread. Smaller object literals make duplicate-key bugs both easier to
 * spot when grepping AND impossible to land — adjacent sections live in
 * different objects, so any genuine duplicate is a clean spread-override
 * the section author can resolve, rather than a TS1117 surprise.

  "Ultra distance power fractions (50K+) are estimates with limited research backing. Riegel's exponent is validated only up to marathon distance. Predictions beyond marathon carry significantly higher uncertainty due to factors like fueling, terrain, heat, and pacing strategy that dominate ultra performance but are not captured by power/pace models.":
    '超长距离 (50K 及以上) 的功率分配比例为估算值，研究数据有限。Riegel 公式的指数仅在全程马拉松以内得到验证。马拉松以上距离的预测不确定性显著上升，因为补给、地形、温度和配速策略等主导超长距离表现的因素无法被功率/配速模型完全捕捉。',
