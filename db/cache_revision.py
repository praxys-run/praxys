"""Per-(user, scope) cache-revision bookkeeping for HTTP ETag revalidation.

L2 (issue #147) — read-heavy / write-rare endpoints can return 304 Not
Modified when no relevant data has changed since the client's last visit.
The "relevant data" question is answered by these scope counters: each
endpoint pack reads a fixed set of tables, those tables are bucketed into
named scopes, and the ETag is a hash of the user's revision counter for
each scope the endpoint consumes.

Scope vocabulary (must stay in lockstep with ``api/etag.py::ENDPOINT_SCOPES``
and the bump points in ``db/sync_writer.py`` + the config-mutation routes):

    activities  — Activity rows (sync-written + AI insights)
    splits      — ActivitySplit rows
    recovery    — RecoveryData rows (Oura sleep/HRV/RHR + Garmin variants)
    fitness     — FitnessData rows (CP, LTHR, threshold pace, max/rest HR)
    plans       — TrainingPlan rows (Stryd push, AI plan upload/upsert/delete)
    config      — UserConfig rows (settings, science choice, goal updates)

A counter beats a timestamp because two writes within the same wall-clock
second still produce distinct revisions, so a 304 cannot accidentally hide
a fresh write that landed in the same second as the prior request.
