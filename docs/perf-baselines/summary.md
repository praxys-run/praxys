# Performance baseline summary

## China delivery topology experiment — 2026-08-08

The latest same-build comparison from a direct Shanghai China Unicom path is
documented in
[`2026-08-08-4fa2942-china-delivery/`](./2026-08-08-4fa2942-china-delivery/).
Three iterations were run for each scenario and device.

| Scenario | Direct Azure LCP D/M | EdgeOne global-ex-mainland LCP D/M | Tencent Lighthouse + gzip LCP D/M |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Cold login → Today | 2.01 / 1.97 s | 2.56 / 2.62 s | **0.66 / 1.55 s** |
| Today → Training | 1.30 / 0.80 s | 3.01 / 0.84 s | **1.20 / 0.72 s** |
| Anonymous landing | 1.92 / 1.77 s | 3.02 / 6.88 s | **1.34 / 0.70 s** |

EdgeOne matched direct Azure within 16 ms on the warm Today path because hashed
assets were already cached, but its Singapore point of presence made cold HTML
revalidation slower and more variable. The mainland static origin reduced HTML
TTFB to roughly 20–35 ms. Nginx compression was essential: without it, the
Lighthouse bandwidth cap made cold LCP 3.7–4.6 seconds.

## Historical optimization arc — pre-arc → post-L3

**TL;DR.** Two weeks of perf work cut user-visible page time by 38–94 % across every login-gated scenario, and turned the cold anonymous-landing experience for CN-without-VPN visitors from "site looks broken" (22 s blank screen) into "site is fast" (1.6 s render). Warm repeat /today is now essentially instant — second-visit API responses return in 0.25 s end-to-end. This doc is the one-page shareable summary; per-anchor detail is in `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<sha>/README.md` directories and the running narrative is in [`2026-04-26-checkpoint.md`](./2026-04-26-checkpoint.md).

## Headline numbers (cn-pc-2 — real mainland-CN ISP, no VPN)

Median of 3 iterations per cell, sitespeed.io 39.5.0 inside Docker.

|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Anonymous landing (cold) | FCP     | 22.5 s → **1.6 s** (−93 %)       | 22.5 s → **1.7 s** (−92 %)      |
| Cold login → Today       | FCP     | 2.9 s → **1.7 s** (−43 %)        | 2.8 s → **1.8 s** (−38 %)       |

| Cold Today → Training    | API p95 | 4.1 s → **1.9 s** (−55 %)        | 4.8 s → **1.7 s** (−64 %)       |
| Warm repeat Today        | LCP     | 4.9 s → **1.4 s** (−71 %)        | 9.7 s → **1.4 s** (−85 %)       |
| Warm repeat Today        | API p95 | 4.1 s → **0.3 s** (−93 %)        | 4.4 s → **0.25 s** (−94 %)      |

**Anchors.** "Before" pre-arc anchors differ by scenario: anonymous landing (S4) compares against `2026-04-24-468ce25/` (the rawest committed baseline, pre-Phase-1, before any work landed); login-gated scenarios (S1/S2/S3) compare against `2026-04-25-d37484b/` (the oldest login-scripted baseline; Phase 1 was already in by then because login-scripting required login-flow work to land first). "After" is `2026-04-27-981b657/` (post-L3 deploy, all backend work landed).

## What landed (rough chronology)

| Layer | What | Headline contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 #1 | Self-hosted fonts (eliminated GFW-blocked Google Fonts) | Most of the −21 s on cold anonymous landing |
| Phase 1 #2-4 | Vendor-chunk code splitting, FastAPI GZip, cache-control headers, PWA precache | Smaller bundle on cold; warm visits read shell from disk |
| F2 (#132) | Collapsed `/api/plan/stryd-status` into `/api/plan` | Removed one round-trip on Training cold load |
| F4 (#141, #142) | Frontend off SWA-Amsterdam onto Azure App Service East Asia (HK) | −575 ms TTFB on every cold visit |
| PR-139 | SQLite WAL pragmas + 20 MB page cache + per-DEK unwrap LRU cache | −33 to −65 % API p95 |
| L1 (#146) | Refactored kitchen-sink `get_dashboard_data` into per-endpoint slim packs | Eliminated 60-85 % of work-per-request that was previously thrown away |
| L2 (#147) | ETag/304 revalidation per slim pack (per-(user,scope) `cache_revisions` counter) | Warm repeat /today returns 304 in ~17 ms p50 server-side |
| L3 (#148) | Materialized per-section dashboard cache at sync_writer commit; reads become indexed SELECTs | Cold reads no longer recompute; second-visit Today is effectively instant |

## Outcomes that matter for users

- **Cold anonymous landing −21 s** for CN-without-VPN. Before: browser timed out fetching Google Fonts CSS, page sat blank for 22+ seconds. After: 1.6 s to first paint. Difference between "this site is broken" and "this site loads fast" for a first-time visitor.
- **Warm repeat Today −85 % mobile LCP** (9.7 s → 1.4 s). The most-frequent path — a returning user reopening Today from a notification or browser tab — is now snappy.
- **Architectural inversion**: pre-F4, friends with VPN had a faster experience because the VPN tunnel bypassed the GFW-throttled CN→Amsterdam path that Static Web Apps was forcing. Post-F4 with origin in East Asia (HK), friends *without* VPN now have the optimal path; VPN routing pays an unnecessary extra hop. This was the right call for the audience.

## Methodology

cn-pc-2 = an operator PC in Shanghai with **passwall2 OFF** (raw mainland-CN ISP path, what real users without VPN experience). 3 iterations per cell, sitespeed.io 39.5.0 inside Docker, Chrome latest. Median values reported. Login-scripted scenarios use the public demo account (`demo@trainsight.dev / demo`) — same defaults as Landing's "Try the demo" CTA.

For the per-cell raw outputs see the per-anchor `README.md` files. HARs are not committed (they contain JWT bearer tokens); they live in the private Azure blob `perfbaselines-archive` per [`ci-setup.md`](./ci-setup.md) for cloud-run baselines, and are kept ephemeral on operator PCs for local-run baselines.
