# Security

How Praxys protects your data and credentials.

## Credential Encryption

Platform credentials (Garmin password, Stryd password, Oura token) and Garmin OAuth sessions are encrypted at rest using envelope encryption. They are **never stored in plaintext**, **never returned to the frontend**, and **never logged**.

### How It Works

Each user's credentials are encrypted with a unique Data Encryption Key (DEK). The DEK itself is wrapped (encrypted) by a Key Encryption Key (KEK):

```
Plaintext credential or OAuth token bundle
    → encrypt with per-user DEK (AES/Fernet)
    → DEK wrapped by KEK
    → only the encrypted blob + wrapped DEK are stored in the database
```

To decrypt, the system unwraps the DEK using the KEK, then decrypts the credential or token bundle. The plaintext DEK and Garmin OAuth tokens exist only in memory during authentication and sync.

### Azure (Cloud Mode)

The KEK is an RSA key managed by **Azure Key Vault**. The App Service accesses Key Vault via **managed identity** — no secrets are stored in environment variables or code. Key Vault handles key rotation, access auditing, and HSM-backed storage.

### Local Mode

The KEK is a **Fernet key** stored in your `.env` file (which is gitignored). Generate it during setup:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Set as `PRAXYS_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`. Without this key, encrypted credentials cannot be decrypted and syncs will fail after a restart.

## Authentication

### JWT Tokens

User sessions use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a 7-day lifetime. Tokens are signed with a server-side secret (`PRAXYS_JWT_SECRET`). Expired tokens are rejected and the user must log in again.

### MCP Sessions and Personal-Context Grants

The official MCP client does not receive or cache the athlete's account JWT.
Login uses random 10-minute browser handoff state plus a separate client-held
exchange secret. First-party approval allows one exchange for a 24-hour opaque
MCP session; only its SHA-256 digest is stored.

Personal context remains deny-by-default after login. A separately approved
15-minute token binds one athlete, MCP actor, `praxys-coach-plugin` audience,
planning purpose, context kind, and structured read/write operations. The
server checks expiry and revocation on every request. A write grant is consumed
after one valid preview and cannot persist context; all durable confirmation,
correction, deletion, and AI-consent actions stay in first-party Praxys
clients. Narrative is never available to plugin or MCP tokens. Local direct-DB
mode resolves the same grant records and checks rather than bypassing them.

### Two Types of Passwords

Praxys handles two distinct categories of passwords differently:

**Your Praxys account password** — hashed with **Argon2id** (winner of the Password Hashing Competition, resistant to GPU and side-channel attacks). The raw password is never stored in plaintext. Used for JWT login only.

**Platform credentials** (Garmin email+password, Stryd email+password, Oura personal access token) — encrypted with **envelope encryption** (per-user AES/Fernet DEK, wrapped by a KEK). These are never returned to the frontend, never logged, only decrypted in memory at sync time, and discarded immediately after the sync API call completes. See [Credential Encryption](#credential-encryption) above for the full scheme.

## Data Isolation

All data is scoped to the authenticated user:

- Every database query filters by `user_id`
- There is no admin "view all users' data" feature
- API endpoints only return data belonging to the requesting user
- Sync operations only access the authenticated user's platform credentials

## Azure Security (Cloud Mode)

When deployed to Azure:

- **Managed identity** — the App Service authenticates to Key Vault without stored secrets
- **HTTPS everywhere** — both the Static Web App (frontend) and App Service (backend) enforce HTTPS
- **CORS restricted** — the backend only accepts requests from the Static Web App domain
- **Key Vault access policy** — only the App Service's managed identity has "Key Vault Crypto User" permissions on the encryption key
- **No shared secrets** — JWT secret and encryption keys are App Service configuration, not in code or CI/CD

## Local Security

When running locally:

- **Encryption key** — stored in `.env`, which is gitignored and never committed
- **Database** — SQLite file stored in `data/`, also gitignored
- **Network** — runs on `localhost` only by default; not exposed to the network unless you configure it
- **Same auth flow** — local mode uses the same registration, JWT, and encryption as cloud mode

## What We Don't Do

- **We don't sell your data.** Praxys is a personal training tool, not an ad platform.
- **We don't share data with third parties.** Your training data stays in your Praxys instance.
- **We don't store more than needed.** We store platform credentials only to sync your data. Activity data stays in your instance's database.
- **We don't send data to AI services without your action.** AI features (training plans, insights) are triggered explicitly by you via the CLI plugin. No background AI processing.
- **We don't track you.** No analytics, no telemetry, no usage tracking in the app.

## Credential Lifecycle

| Event | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Connect a platform | Credentials encrypted with per-user DEK, wrapped DEK + encrypted blob stored in DB |
| Sync runs | Credentials and any Garmin OAuth bundle are decrypted in memory, used for API calls, then discarded |
| Disconnect a platform | Encrypted credentials and OAuth tokens deleted from DB |
| View connections (API/UI) | Only connection status returned — credentials are never sent to the frontend |
| Server logs | Credential values are never logged, even at debug level |

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue. Contact the repository owner directly.
