# API Reference

All endpoints are under the `/api/` prefix. The API server runs on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

**Authentication:** All data endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in the request header. Tokens are obtained via `POST /api/auth/login`.

## Auth

### POST /api/auth/register

Register a new user.

- **First user** on a fresh DB becomes admin (no code, auto-verified).
- Email matching `PRAXYS_ADMIN_EMAIL` → admin (no code, auto-verified).
- A valid **invitation code** → normal user (auto-verified; invited users bypass the seat cap).
- **Open self-registration** (admin-enabled gate, under the committed-seat cap, no code) →
  created *unverified*; a verification link is emailed and the user cannot log in until they
  click it (see `POST /api/auth/verify`). If SMTP is not configured, the account is created
  verified instead.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "invitation_code": "TS-ABCD-1234",
  "accepted_terms": true,
  "website": ""
}
```

- `invitation_code` — optional; omit for the first user, `PRAXYS_ADMIN_EMAIL`, or an open sign-up.
- `accepted_terms` — **required** (`true`); the EULA gate.
- `website` — **honeypot**; must be empty. A non-empty value is treated as a bot and rejected.

**Response** (verified path — first user / admin email / invited):
```json
{ "id": "uuid-string", "email": "user@example.com", "is_superuser": false }
```

**Response** (open sign-up needing email verification):
```json
{ "verification_required": true, "email": "user@example.com" }
```

**Error codes:**
- `400 REGISTER_USER_ALREADY_EXISTS` — email already registered
- `400 REGISTER_TERMS_NOT_ACCEPTED` — `accepted_terms` was not `true`
- `400 REGISTER_INVALID_INVITATION` — code is invalid, used, expired, or revoked
- `400 REGISTER_FAILED` — honeypot tripped (or an opaque create failure)
- `403 REGISTER_CLOSED` — self-registration is disabled or the seat cap is reached

### POST /api/auth/login

Obtain a JWT access token. Uses FastAPI-Users auth backend.

**Request body** (form-encoded):
```
username=user@example.com&password=securepassword
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### GET /api/auth/me

Return the authenticated user's profile.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "is_superuser": true,
  "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00"
}
```

### POST /api/auth/request-verify-token

Request (or re-send) an email-ownership verification link. Always returns `202` regardless of
whether the address exists (no account enumeration); sends an email only when SMTP is configured.

**Request body:** `{ "email": "user@example.com" }`

### POST /api/auth/verify

Consume a verification token (from the emailed link `…/verify?token=…`) and mark the account
verified, unblocking login.

**Request body:** `{ "token": "<token>" }`

Errors: `400 VERIFY_USER_ALREADY_VERIFIED`, `400 VERIFY_USER_BAD_TOKEN` (FastAPI-Users).

### GET /api/public/config

**Unauthenticated.** Minimal boot config for the login page.

**Response:** `{ "registration_open": true }`

- `registration_open` — effective state (admin flag **and** committed seats < cap). No counts or
  other operator data are exposed here.

## Admin

All admin endpoints require `is_superuser=True` on the authenticated user. Returns `403` otherwise.

### GET /api/admin/ops/summary

Privacy-safe operations overview. Query parameter `window` is one of `24h`, `7d`,
or `28d` (default `24h`). Every section includes `source`, `window`, `freshness`,
`as_of`, and an optional stable `reason` code (`section_refresh_failed`,
`azure_telemetry_not_configured`, `azure_sdk_unavailable`,
`azure_query_failed`, `azure_query_partial`, or `azure_query_timed_out`).

Database-backed attention/activity aggregates and live component health are
combined with aggregate-only telemetry from the trusted backend Application
Insights component: request/availability health, Azure alert instances,
Today/Decision Check/Coach value signals, sync reliability, systemic failure
clusters (at least five distinct users across systemic failure classes for one
platform within 15 minutes), and connection outcomes. The response contains no emails, user IDs or
pseudonyms, feedback text/screenshots, invitation codes, Coach comments, raw log
rows, or trace bodies. One failed section does not fail the whole response.
Responses are `private, no-store`; Azure-backed sections use a short server-side
cache and may explicitly report `freshness: "stale"`.

### GET /api/admin/users

List all registered users.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "is_active": true,
      "is_superuser": true,
      "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}

Delete a user and cascade-delete all their data (activities, splits, recovery, fitness, plans, connections, config). Cannot delete yourself.

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "deleted", "email": "user@example.com" }
```

### PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/role

Toggle admin role for a user. Cannot change your own role.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "is_superuser": true }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "is_superuser": true
}
```

### POST /api/admin/invitations

Generate a one-time invitation code (format: `TS-XXXX-XXXX`).

**Request body (optional):**
```json
{ "note": "For teammate Alice" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "code": "TS-A1B2-C3D4", "note": "For teammate Alice" }
```

### GET /api/admin/invitations

List all invitation codes with usage status.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "invitations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "code": "TS-A1B2-C3D4",
      "note": "For teammate Alice",
      "is_active": true,
      "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00",
      "used_by": null,
      "used_at": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### DELETE /api/admin/invitations/{id}

Revoke an invitation code (cannot be used after this).

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "revoked", "code": "TS-A1B2-C3D4" }
```

### POST /api/admin/demo-accounts

Create a read-only demo account that mirrors the creating admin's data. Demo users can browse all pages but cannot modify anything (403 on all write endpoints).

**Request:**
```json
{ "email": "demo@example.com", "password": "demo-pass" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "demo@example.com",
  "is_demo": true,
  "demo_of": "admin-user-id"
}
```

### GET /api/admin/config

Registration gate, seat cap, activity gauge, and email availability.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "registration": {
    "registration_open": true, "flag_enabled": true, "max_users": 100,
    "registered_users": 12, "outstanding_invitations": 3,
    "committed_seats": 15, "remaining": 85, "cap_reached": false
  },
  "activity": { "dau": 4, "wau": 9, "mau": 11, "total_users": 12 },
  "email_configured": true
}
```

### PATCH /api/admin/config

Toggle self-registration and/or set the seat cap. Both fields optional.

**Request:** `{ "registration_open": true, "registration_max_users": 100 }`

**Response:** same shape as `GET /api/admin/config`. `400` if `registration_max_users < 0`.

The **seat cap counts committed seats** = registered non-demo users **plus** outstanding
(active, unused, unexpired) invitation codes. Self-registration auto-closes when committed ≥ cap;
admin-issued invitations bypass it.

### GET /api/admin/waitlist

List waitlist signups (newest first), each with any issued invitation code.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "signups": [
    {
      "id": 1, "email": "lead@example.com", "note": "sub-3 marathon",
      "locale": "zh", "created_at": "2026-07-01T10:00:00+00:00",
      "invited_at": null, "invitation_id": null, "invitation_code": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /api/admin/announcements

Return all system announcements, including inactive rows, for the communications
management route. Regular authenticated users continue to receive active rows only
from `GET /api/announcements`.

### POST /api/admin/waitlist/{id}/invite

Generate a 14-day invitation code for a waitlist signup, mark the row, and email the code + a
prefilled register link (when SMTP is configured). Re-inviting revokes the prior unused code.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sent": true, "email_configured": true, "code": "TS-A1B2-C3D4",
  "email": "lead@example.com",
  "invite_url": "https://praxys.run/login?invite=TS-A1B2-C3D4",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-18T10:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## Today

### GET /api/today

Deterministic same-day training signal. `signal` is the sole authority for the
recommendation, reason, and alternatives; Today does not load or generate an
LLM `daily_brief`.

Recovery classification is HRV-based. The current HRV observation is excluded
from its own historical baseline; the default method requires seven preceding
valid observations. `rolling_days` and `baseline_days` are retained configuration
names, but they count valid observations rather than calendar days. Identical
historical observations have zero variance and therefore return
`classification_reason = "zero_variance"` instead of a normal classification.
An HRV reading from today or yesterday is current. Older HRV
is retained for provenance but sets `hrv_is_stale = true`, returns
`recovery_analysis.status = "insufficient_data"`, and cannot adjust the same-day
signal. Sleep, readiness, and resting heart rate remain available as separate
informational context when the source provides them. Recovery and plan frames use
one configured provider at a time rather than blending overlapping sources.

**Response:**
```json

```

`reason` and `alternatives` are deterministic English fallbacks. Clients should
localize the stable `reason_code` / `alternative_codes` and interpolate their
argument maps without changing the recommendation. `week_load` is `null` when no
current-week activity or plan load exists; `recovery_analysis`, `last_activity`,
and `recovery_theory` are also nullable. `signal.recovery.tsb` is `null` until the
account has one active CTL time constant of history. A null TSB is excluded from
same-day decisions and clients render it as unavailable rather than as a balanced
value of zero. The one-time-constant history gate and displayed TSB labels are
Praxys product estimates, not validated physiological cutoffs.

`heat_adaptation` is a qualitative evidence tracker. It prefers
timestamp-weighted sample power when it covers at least 90% of activity duration
and otherwise falls back to activity splits; sample gaps over five seconds do
not count toward coverage, and activity `avg_power` is never used for exposure
workload. The selected sample/split provider must be known and match
`cp_power_provider` because Garmin and Stryd running-power scales are not
interchangeable. For `cp_source: "activities"`, `cp_power_provider` is the
provider persisted with a provider-specific, running-only activity CP fit. The
fit uses the configured primary activity provider when present; otherwise it is
created only when the eligible activity set has one unambiguous provider.
Matching split provenance is required and cycling is excluded. Sessions expose
`power_provider`, `cp_source`, `cp_power_provider`, `power_source_alignment`,
`sample_coverage_ratio`, and `workload_evaluable` so clients can distinguish a
provider mismatch, unverified provenance, incomplete samples, and work that was
genuinely below threshold.

`recent_conditions` summarizes only qualifying sessions inside the active
14-day window. It is `null` when no current qualifying session exists, and
excluded or older observations cannot widen its temperature or humidity
range. It describes the recent training conditions represented by the model;
it is not a target climate and does not assess current weather. For
`maintaining` and `decaying`, the stage can come from an older qualifying
block, so `recent_conditions` must not be presented as that historical
block's condition range.

Environmental context is one provenance-tagged outdoor activity-summary
temperature/RH pair; treadmill and indoor summary weather are discarded.
Evidence uses the stronger of a Stull psychrometric wet-bulb ramp and a dry-bulb
ramp; the ramps are never added, and the result is not WBGT. The Stull proxy
assumes standard sea-level pressure and is returned as `null` outside its 5-99%
RH domain; the independent dry-bulb ramp can still contribute. Wind, solar
radiation, within-session weather, clothing, hydration state, and measured core
or skin temperature are excluded. The 18-26 C wet-bulb ramp, 30-40 C dry-bulb
ramp, max combination, 50% CP workload floor, five-second sample-interval gate,
90% sample-coverage gate, 30-effective-minute session gate, 14-day active
window, general 2-day/60-minute Building threshold, resumed-exposure
Reacclimating label, 7-day/420-minute Likely adapted threshold,
effective-minute weighting, retention through day 7, and decay after day 7
through day 28 are Praxys operational estimates, not validated physiological
cutoffs or a dose model.
Confidence describes evaluable data coverage, not the probability of individual
physiological adaptation. The status is not medical clearance or a current
heat-risk assessment, and restrictive `signal` recommendations replace its
normal-training action with `follow_today_signal`.

`coach_snapshot` is an opaque cache/source version retained for response
compatibility. It is not an insight identifier and clients should not use it to
request same-day prose.

`summary` contains server-computed display metrics so web, miniapp, and legacy
dashboard consumers do not duplicate training formulas. `current_tsb` is `null`
until the account has one active CTL time constant of history.
`distribution_match_pct` is `null` unless every recent activity has at least 90%
duration coverage from split or timestamped sample intensity and every zone has
a target. Timestamped samples also require a median cadence of five seconds or
less. `load_compliance_pct` uses only completed weeks where both actual and
planned load have exact selected-base inputs and the plan target is positive.
It is `null` until at least two such weeks exist. A week is complete only after
Sunday has passed and daily load contains all seven Monday-through-Sunday dates.
The result is a descriptive mean actual-to-planned load ratio, not a quality,
safety, recovery, or readiness score. `week_actual_estimated` and
`week_planned_estimated` provide the per-week provenance; estimated bars remain
visible but are excluded from the summary. Durationless `rest` and `off` plan
rows are exact zero load; other durationless rows remain estimated.
`load_time_constant_days` comes from the active load theory and controls
`pmc_sufficient`. Both the one-time-constant sufficiency gate and the two-week
minimum are Praxys product estimates rather than validated physiological cutoffs.

`heat_adaptation` has the same evidence and safety contract as the Today field,
but Training is the client surface for the longitudinal experience.
`recent_conditions` describes the current qualifying temperature and humidity
range. For Building and Likely adapted, it supplies the conditions behind the
current evidence. Maintaining and Decaying can inherit from an older block, so
clients explicitly separate that retained/fading stage from the current range.
`cadence` is the complete server-computed daily aggregate for the active
window; `sessions` remains a bounded latest-evidence ledger for progressive
disclosure. Clients keep the cadence, effective-minute mechanics, and
inclusion reasons behind an optional evidence disclosure.

When valid split-level intensity evidence is absent, `max`, `avg_work`,
`supra_cp_sessions`, and `total_quality_sessions` are `null`, and
`evidence_complete` is `false`. HR- and pace-based accounts may receive a coarse
`activity_averages` distribution for display, but it never qualifies for
`distribution_match_pct`. When no usable intensity exists, the distribution keeps
its stable array shape with zero placeholders and `distribution_resolution` is
`unavailable`; clients must not interpret those zeros as completed recovery-zone
time or zero quality work.

## Goal

### GET /api/goal

Race prediction and goal tracking.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "race_countdown": {
    "distance": "marathon",
    "distance_label": "Marathon",
    "mode": "race_date|cp_milestone|continuous|none",

  "latest_cp": 247.8,
  "training_base": "power",
  "display": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

> **Units.** `latest_cp`, `current_cp`, `target_cp`, `cp_trend.values` are in the user's
> base-native threshold unit (watts for power, bpm for HR, sec/km for pace).
> Pair with `display.threshold_unit` to format. `actual_load` / `planned_load`
> similarly carry RSS / TRIMP / rTSS depending on the training base; pair with
> `display.load_label`.

## History

### GET /api/history

Paginated activity history.

**Query params:**
- `limit` (int, 1-100, default 20)
- `offset` (int, default 0)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "date": "2026-04-07",
      "distance_km": 9.43,
      "duration_sec": 3233,
      "avg_power": 210.0,
      "avg_hr": 155,
      "avg_pace_min_km": "5:42",
      "rss": 64.8,
      "splits": [{ "split_num": 1, "avg_power": 220, "duration_sec": 300 }]
    }
  ],
  "total": 150,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "training_base": "power",
  "display": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

## Plan

### GET /api/plan

The user's AI plan within a window, plus per-row Stryd sync state and the
caller's Stryd push history.

The canonical plan is the AI-authored one (`source='ai'`); Stryd plan rows
in the same window are surfaced as a `sync_state` flag on each AI row and
as `stryd_only_dates` for Stryd entries with no AI counterpart.

**Query params:**
- `start` *(YYYY-MM-DD, default = today)* — window start.
- `end` *(YYYY-MM-DD, default = `start + 14 days`)* — window end. Inverted
  or longer-than-365-day windows return 400.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "workouts": [
    {
      "date": "2026-04-11",
      "workout_type": "threshold",
      "duration_min": 65,
      "distance_km": 11.0,
      "power_min": 235,
      "power_max": 255,
      "description": "WU 10min, 2x20min @235-255W...",
      "sync_state": "synced"
    }
  ],
  "stryd_status": {
    "2026-04-11": { "workout_id": "stryd_123", "pushed_at": "...", "status": "pushed" }
  },
  "sync_target": "stryd",
  "stryd_only_dates": ["2026-04-13"],
  "window": { "start": "2026-04-11", "end": "2026-04-25" }
}
```

`sync_state` is one of:
- `synced` — Stryd has a matching workout whose id equals the one we
  logged on push (a re-push is a no-op).
- `mismatch` — Stryd has a workout on this date but we don't recognise
  its id (user-edited on Stryd, or never pushed). The UI confirms before
  overwriting.
- `not_synced` — No Stryd workout on this date.

`sync_target` is `"stryd"` when the user has a Stryd connection, else
`null` — clients can hide the entire sync column when it's `null`.

### POST /api/plan/push-stryd

Push only Praxys-authored plan rows (`source = "ai"`) to the Stryd calendar. Imported Stryd rows are never eligible, even when they are the analytically preferred plan source.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "workout_dates": ["2026-04-11", "2026-04-12"] }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    { "date": "2026-04-11", "status": "pushed", "workout_id": "stryd_123" }
  ]
}
```

### DELETE /api/plan/stryd-workout/{workout_id}

Remove a workout from Stryd calendar.

### POST /api/plan/upload

Upload an AI-generated training plan as CSV text. The body is `{"csv": "..."}`
where the CSV uses the columns `date,workout_type,planned_duration_min,
planned_distance_km,target_power_min,target_power_max,workout_description`.

**Query params:**
- `mode=replace` *(default)* — delete every future AI plan row for the user,
  then insert the payload. Past rows survive. Used by full-plan generation
  (the AI training-plan skill writes a 28-day window).
- `mode=merge` — upsert by `(user, date, source='ai')`. Only the dates in the
  payload are touched; other AI rows (past and future) are preserved. Used
  for partial edits like shifting a single workout.

**Response:** `{ "status": "saved", "rows": <int>, "mode": "replace"|"merge" }`

### PUT /api/plan/{date}

Upsert a single AI plan workout for the given date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Replaces any
existing `(user, date, source='ai')` row(s) with one new row from the body;
other dates are untouched. Prefer this over `/plan/upload` when editing one
day so you don't have to round-trip the whole future window.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "workout_type": "easy",
  "planned_duration_min": 45,
  "planned_distance_km": 8.0,
  "target_power_min": 150,
  "target_power_max": 200,
  "workout_description": "Easy aerobic run"
}
```

**Response:** the upserted row (`id`, `date`, `workout_type`, …, `source`).

### DELETE /api/plan/{date}

Delete the AI plan workout(s) for the given date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Idempotent —
deleting a missing date returns `{ "status": "deleted", "rows": 0 }`.

## Settings

### GET /api/settings

Current configuration, platform capabilities, and detected thresholds.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "config": {
    "connections": ["garmin", "stryd", "oura"],
    "preferences": { "activities": "garmin", "recovery": "oura", "plan": "ai" },
    "training_base": "power",
    "thresholds": { "cp_watts": null, "lthr_bpm": null, "source": "auto" },
    "zones": { "power": [0.55, 0.75, 0.90, 1.05] },
    "goal": { "distance": "marathon", "target_time_sec": 10800 },
    "science": { "load": "banister_pmc", "zones": "coggan_5zone" }
  },
  "platform_capabilities": {
    "garmin": { "activities": true, "recovery": true, "fitness": true, "plan": false }
  },
  "detected_thresholds": {
    "cp_watts": { "value": 247.8, "source": "stryd" }
  },
  "effective_thresholds": {
    "cp_watts": { "value": 247.8, "origin": "auto (stryd)" }
  },
  "display": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

### PUT /api/settings

Update settings (partial update).

**Request body:** Any subset of config fields:
```json
{
  "training_base": "hr",
  "goal": { "distance": "half_marathon", "target_time_sec": 5400 }
}
```

### GET /api/settings/connections

Return connected platforms and their status. Credentials are never exposed.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "connections": {
    "garmin": {
      "status": "connected",
      "last_sync": "2026-04-10T08:30:00",
      "has_credentials": true
    },
    "stryd": {
      "status": "disconnected",
      "last_sync": null,
      "has_credentials": false
    }
  }
}
```

### POST /api/settings/connections/{platform}

Connect a platform by storing encrypted credentials. Platform must be one of: `garmin`, `stryd`, `oura`.

**Request body (Garmin/Stryd):**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "platform-password",
  "is_cn": false
}
```

**Request body (Oura):**
```json
{
  "token": "oura-personal-access-token"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "connected", "platform": "garmin" }
```

### POST /api/settings/connections/garmin/login

Connect Garmin interactively. Unlike the generic endpoint above (which stores
credentials and defers login to the background sync), this validates the
credentials up front so an account with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
enabled can be prompted for its code. On success the credentials are persisted
and the OAuth tokens cached for future syncs.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "garmin-password",
  "is_cn": false
}
```

**Response (no MFA):**
```json
{ "status": "connected", "platform": "garmin" }
```

**Response (MFA required):** the client must follow up with the verification
code Garmin sends:
```json
{ "status": "mfa_required", "platform": "garmin" }
```

**Response (bad credentials / rate limited):**
```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "..." }
```

### POST /api/settings/connections/garmin/mfa

Complete a pending interactive Garmin login (see above) with the MFA
verification code. The pending login is process-local and expires after a few
minutes; a wrong code can be retried within that window.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "code": "123456" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "connected", "platform": "garmin" }
```

A missing/expired pending login returns
`{ "status": "error", "message": "mfa_session_expired" }`.

### DELETE /api/settings/connections/{platform}

Disconnect a platform and delete stored credentials.

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "disconnected", "platform": "garmin" }
```

## Science

### GET /api/science

Active theories, available options, fixed operational models, and
recommendations.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "active": {
    "load": { "id": "banister_pmc", "name": "Banister PMC", "..." : "..." },
    "zones": { "id": "coggan_5zone", "name": "Coggan 5-Zone", "..." : "..." },
    "heat": { "id": "praxys_heat_evidence", "name": "Praxys Heat Acclimatization Evidence", "..." : "..." }
  },
  "available": {
    "load": [{ "id": "banister_pmc", "..." : "..." }, { "id": "banister_ultra", "..." : "..." }],
    "zones": [{ "id": "coggan_5zone", "..." : "..." }, { "id": "polarized_3zone", "..." : "..." }]
  },
  "fixed_pillars": ["heat"],
  "label_sets": [{ "id": "standard", "name": "Standard" }],
  "recommendations": [
    { "pillar": "zones", "recommended_id": "coggan_5zone", "reason": "...", "confidence": 0.85 }
  ]
}
```

### PUT /api/science

Update theory selections.

Only selectable pillars (`load`, `recovery`, `prediction`, and `zones`) are
updated. Fixed pillars such as `heat` remain active even if a client includes
them in the request.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "science": { "zones": "polarized_3zone" },
  "zone_labels": "standard"
}
```

## Sync

### GET /api/sync/status

Current sync status for all sources.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "garmin": { "status": "idle|syncing|done|error", "last_sync": "ISO timestamp", "error": null },
  "stryd": { "..." : "..." },
  "oura": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

### POST /api/sync/{source}

Trigger sync for a single source (garmin, stryd, oura). Runs in background.

**Request body (optional):**
```json
{ "from_date": "2025-01-01" }
```

### POST /api/sync

Trigger sync for all configured sources.

## Insights and product events

### GET /api/insights and GET /api/insights/{insight_type}

Returns durable model-generated insights for `training_review` and
`race_forecast`. The list endpoint always omits legacy `daily_brief` rows, and
`GET /api/insights/daily_brief` always returns `{"insight": null}`. Today clients
must render `/api/today.signal` instead.

### POST /api/insights

Pushes a durable insight from a CLI or MCP workflow. `training_review` and
`race_forecast` are accepted. A `daily_brief` push returns HTTP 410 with
`DAILY_BRIEF_DETERMINISTIC` so client prose can never replace the canonical
same-day signal.

### POST /api/insights/{insight_type}/feedback

Submit one vote for the exact generated Coach insight the authenticated user saw.
Uses the current user's id (not demo-source data) and supports `training_review`
or `race_forecast`. Feedback for `daily_brief` returns HTTP 410 with
`DAILY_BRIEF_DETERMINISTIC`.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "vote": "up",
  "dataset_hash": "64-character SHA-256 hex digest",
  "comment": "Optional, at most 200 characters"
}
```

The current row's `meta.dataset_hash` must match. One submission is accepted per
`(user, insight_type, dataset_hash)`; repeats return `duplicate: true`, even if
that dataset disappears during regeneration and later becomes current again.
The durable `ai_insight_feedback` row and current `AiInsight.meta.feedback`
contain only `dataset_hash`, `vote`, and `submitted_at`. The raw comment is not
persisted; telemetry receives a scrubbed 120-character excerpt.
`GET /api/insights/{insight_type}` also returns server-derived
`feedback_allowed`; it is `false` for read-only demo views, where clients must
hide feedback controls.
**Response:**
```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "duplicate": false,
  "feedback": {
    "dataset_hash": "...",
    "vote": "up",
    "submitted_at": "2026-07-12T08:30:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

Errors: `404 INSIGHT_NOT_FOUND`, `409 INSIGHT_FEEDBACK_UNVERSIONED`,
`409 INSIGHT_FEEDBACK_STALE`, `410 DAILY_BRIEF_DETERMINISTIC`,
`429 INSIGHT_FEEDBACK_RATE_LIMITED`.

### POST /api/product-events/today-feedback-claim

Reserve the account's Today Decision Check while the client renders it. The
request has no body and returns `{ "accepted": true, "duplicate": false }` when
the prompt may render. A duplicate response means another client has a recent
claim or the prompt was shown within the rolling seven-day cadence. Unconfirmed
claims stop blocking competing renders after two minutes and do not count as
prompt exposure unless a later submission backfills the lost confirmation.

After rendering, the client confirms exposure with `today_feedback_shown` on
`POST /api/product-events`.

### POST /api/product-events

Record an authenticated, privacy-safe product event from web or miniapp. The
server derives `user_id_hash` and timestamp. Extra fields are rejected.
`app_version` must be `develop`, a release CalVer (`YYYY.MM.MICRO`), or an
auto-deploy build (`YYYY.MM.DD.RUN-abcdef0`). Other free-form strings are
rejected so secrets cannot be smuggled into telemetry dimensions.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "today_feedback_submitted",
  "surface": "miniapp",
  "app_version": "2026.07.1",
  "response": "confirmed_plan"
}
```

Allowed events: `app_opened`, `today_brief_rendered`,
`today_reasoning_opened`, `today_feedback_shown`, and
`today_feedback_submitted`. `response` is required only for the submission event
and must be one of `changed_plan`, `confirmed_plan`, `not_helpful`, or
`not_training`.

**Response:** `{ "accepted": true, "duplicate": false }`. Identical lifecycle
events are short-window deduplicated. `today_feedback_shown` confirms a recent
render claim and persists the account-wide seven-day cadence. The first
`today_feedback_submitted` is accepted for a claimed or confirmed prompt
within that seven-day cadence. The two-minute lease limits competing renders;
it does not invalidate a prompt already visible to the user. A submission can
backfill a lost render confirmation, while later answers return
`duplicate: true`.

Errors: `409 PRODUCT_EVENT_PROMPT_NOT_CLAIMED`,
`409 PRODUCT_EVENT_PROMPT_NOT_RENDERED`, and
`429 PRODUCT_EVENT_RATE_LIMITED` after 60 requests per user per minute.

## Health

### GET /api/health

Unauthenticated health check.

**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## Common Response Fields

Every endpoint that returns training data includes:

- **`training_base`**: `"power"`, `"hr"`, or `"pace"` — the user's configured training base
- **`display`**: Dynamic labels and units for the active training base:
  - `threshold_label`: "Critical Power" / "Lactate Threshold HR" / "Threshold Pace"
  - `threshold_abbrev`: "CP" / "LTHR" / "T-Pace"
  - `threshold_unit`: "W" / "bpm" / "/km"
  - `load_label`: "RSS" / "TRIMP" / "rTSS"
  - `load_unit`: "" (empty string)
  - `intensity_metric`: "Power" / "Heart Rate" / "Pace"
  - `zone_names`: Zone name array from active theory
  - `trend_label`: "CP Trend" / "LTHR Trend" / "Pace Trend"
