# Configuration & secrets

> **Summary:** Every Praxys config value, **where it is set** (the source of
> truth), what consumes it, and how to rotate it.
> **Use when:** Adding/changing/rotating an env var, secret, or build variable —
> or debugging "I changed a setting in the portal and it reverted".

## The golden rule

The backend's App Service **application settings are owned by the deploy
workflow**, not the portal. `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` → *Sync App
Service settings* runs `az webapp config appsettings set` on **every deploy**
with a fixed list sourced from GitHub Actions secrets/variables (plus a few
literals). **Editing those keys in the Azure Portal is transient — the next
deploy overwrites them.** To change one permanently, update the GitHub
secret/variable (or the workflow literal) and re-deploy.

## Where each thing lives

### GitHub Actions → Secrets
`Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets`

| Secret | Purpose | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` / `AZURE_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | OIDC login to Azure (no client secret) | all deploy workflows (`azure/login`) |
| `PRAXYS_JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key | pushed to App Service setting by `deploy-backend.yml` |
| `WECHAT_MINIAPP_APPID` / `WECHAT_MINIAPP_SECRET` | WeChat Mini Program auth | App Service setting (backend) |
| `WECHAT_MINIAPP_UPLOAD_KEY` | Mini program CI upload key | `miniapp-publish.yml` |

### GitHub Actions → Variables
`… → Variables` (non-secret; build variables are inlined into the SPA and ship to browsers)

| Variable | Purpose | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` (`https://api.praxys.run`) | API base baked into the SPA | `deploy-frontend-appservice.yml` build |
| `VITE_APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Browser RUM | SPA build |
| `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint for insights/triage | App Service setting + `i18n.yml` |
| `KEY_VAULT_URL` / `KEY_VAULT_KEY_NAME` | Key Vault + RSA key name | App Service setting |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | App Insights routing | App Service setting |

### Azure App Service → Application settings (backend `trainsight-app`)
Source of truth = `deploy-backend.yml`. Literals set inline: `DATA_DIR=/home/data`,
`WEBSITES_PORT=8000`, `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`,
`WEBSITE_HTTPLOGGING_RETENTION_DAYS=3`. Everything else comes from the
secrets/variables above.

### Azure Key Vault (`kv-trainsight`)
- RSA key `credential-encryption-key` — the master key that wraps the per-user
  Fernet data-encryption keys (DEKs) protecting platform credentials
  (`db/crypto.py`). The App Service MI has *Key Vault Crypto User*. **Not** a
  plain env var.

### Local development → `.env`
Local only; never committed. See [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) for the full
annotated list. Minimum: `PRAXYS_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Fernet); `PRAXYS_ENV=development`
to boot without a JWT secret.

## Adding a NEW backend setting (checklist)

1. Read it in code via `os.environ` / `getenv_compat` (treat unset as a safe default).
2. Add it to `.env.example` (annotated) for local dev.
3. Add it to `deploy-backend.yml`: the `env:` block (from `secrets.*` or `vars.*`)
   **and** the `az webapp config appsettings set` arg list.
4. If it must be present, add it to the *required-settings* loop; if optional,
   **leave it out** of that loop so an unset value can't fail the deploy.
5. Create the GitHub secret (sensitive) or variable (non-sensitive).

> Example: the feedback → GitHub-issue settings (`PRAXYS_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
> `PRAXYS_FEEDBACK_GITHUB_*`) follow exactly this pattern and are intentionally
> optional. (Added by the feedback feature — dddtc2005/praxys#328.)

## Rotation

| Value | How | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `PRAXYS_JWT_SECRET` | New `secrets.PRAXYS_JWT_SECRET`, re-deploy backend | **All active sessions invalidated** — every user must log in again. |
| `WECHAT_MINIAPP_SECRET` | Rotate in mp.weixin.qq.com, update GitHub secret, re-deploy | Mini program auth briefly fails until deploy lands. |
| `WECHAT_MINIAPP_UPLOAD_KEY` | Regenerate in mp.weixin.qq.com, update GitHub secret | Only affects mini program CI publishing. |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Update variable, re-deploy | Telemetry routes to the new resource. |
| GitHub PAT for feedback (`PRAXYS_GITHUB_TOKEN`) | **Runbook:** [rotate-github-pat.md](./rotate-github-pat.md). **Better:** avoid rotation entirely with a GitHub App — [setup-github-app.md](./setup-github-app.md). | Issue auto-filing dormant until updated; rest of app unaffected. |
| Key Vault RSA key `credential-encryption-key` | ⚠️ **High-impact** — the per-user DEKs were wrapped with the current key; rotating without a re-wrap/re-encrypt migration makes stored platform credentials undecryptable. **TODO(@dddtc2005):** document the re-wrap drill before rotating. | Users would have to reconnect platforms. |
