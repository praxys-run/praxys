# Admin tasks

> **Summary:** The admin operations console and focused management workflows.
> **Use when:** Checking health and attention queues, or managing users, incidents,
> feedback, invitations, demo accounts, and announcements.

## Who is an admin

`users.is_superuser = true`. On a fresh DB the **first registered user** becomes
admin automatically. The address in `PRAXYS_ADMIN_EMAIL` is always granted admin
on register. Everyone else needs an invitation code — unless **self-registration** is open (see Registration below). All `/api/admin/*` endpoints
enforce `require_admin` (403 otherwise) — see `api/views.py`.

The web-only admin console is split into focused routes. `/admin` redirects to the
operations overview:

- `/admin/ops` — attention queue, live service health, and aggregate usage context
- `/admin/users` — registration, seats, users, invitations, waitlist, demo accounts
- `/admin/feedback` — feedback triage and GitHub reconciliation
- `/admin/incidents` — public-status incident management
- `/admin/communications` — system announcements

The API equivalents are listed below for scripting.

## Operations overview

Open `/admin/ops` for the first-response view. The
`GET /api/admin/ops/summary?window=24h|7d|28d` endpoint returns aggregate-only
sections with an explicit `source`, `window`, `freshness`, and `as_of` value:

- **Needs attention:** active incident counts and actionable feedback counts,
  including critical/high priority totals.
- **Service health:** live API, database, and background-sync component probes,
  PostgreSQL connection pressure, plus trusted request, availability, latency,
  and database-health telemetry.
- **Product value:** registered users plus DAU/WAU/MAU based on authenticated
  request activity (labeled **directional**), alongside trusted Today reach,
  Decision Check response/value rates, repeated use, and Coach usefulness.
  Trusted product telemetry uses a fixed trailing 28-day window so repeated
  weekly use remains meaningful.
- **Agent learning:** durable change-loop decision/outcome counts, shadow and
  human-override totals, merged-PR outcomes, policy versions, and the current
  autonomy level. It exposes aggregates only, never decision inputs.
- **Azure alerts and platform health:** selected-window alert history plus any
  currently fired retained alert, per-platform sync reliability, systemic
  failure clusters (at least five distinct users across systemic failure
  classes for one platform within 15 minutes), and connection outcomes from the
  trusted `appi-praxys-backend` telemetry boundary.

The response never contains emails, raw user IDs, invitation codes, feedback
text/screenshots, Coach comments, raw log rows, or trace bodies. Every section
fails independently, so an unavailable summary block does not disable the
focused management routes. The endpoint is admin-only and returns
`Cache-Control: private, no-store`; Azure-backed subsections use a three-minute
server-side cache with a bounded stale fallback. See
[monitoring-and-alerts.md](./monitoring-and-alerts.md#in-app-admin-operations-read-model)
for the read boundary and cache behavior.

## Invitations

- UI: `/admin/users` → **Invitation codes** → generate / copy / revoke codes.
- API: `POST /api/admin/invitations` (`{note}`) → `{code}`; `GET /api/admin/invitations`;
  `DELETE /api/admin/invitations/{id}`.

## Registration (open / close + seat cap)

Praxys is invitation-only by default. To let people sign up without a code:

- UI: `/admin/users` → **Registration** → toggle **Self-registration** on and set the
  **seat cap**. The public login page then shows a "Create account" path; new
  code-less sign-ups must **verify their email** (requires SMTP — see below)
  before they can log in.
- API: `GET /api/admin/config` (status + DAU/WAU gauge + `email_configured`);
  `PATCH /api/admin/config` (`{registration_open, registration_max_users}`).
  Unauthenticated `GET /api/public/config` exposes **only** the effective boolean.

**Seat cap = committed seats** = registered non-demo users **plus** outstanding
(active, unused, unexpired) invitation codes. Sending an invitation reserves a
seat, so an invited user is never turned away at the door. Self-registration
**auto-closes** when committed ≥ cap; admin-issued invitations are deliberate and
still allowed past it. The DAU/WAU tiles are the readiness gauge — review before
raising the cap (100 → 1000; see [cost-and-scaling.md](./cost-and-scaling.md)).

**Email is required for the full experience** (verification + auto-sent invites).
Without `PRAXYS_SMTP_*` configured (see
[config-and-secrets.md](./config-and-secrets.md)), open sign-ups are created
*verified* (no ownership check) and invitation codes are shown for you to
copy/email by hand.

## Waitlist → invite

Prospective users who joined the waitlist (login page, or the WeChat mini program)
appear in `/admin/users` → **Waitlist**.

- **Invite** a row → generates a 14-day invitation code, marks the row, and emails
  the code + a prefilled register link (if SMTP is configured; otherwise copy the
  code or use the mailto fallback shown in the result). **Re-invite** revokes the
  previous unused code and issues a fresh one.
- API: `GET /api/admin/waitlist`; `POST /api/admin/waitlist/{id}/invite`.

## User roles

- Promote/demote: `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/role` (`{is_superuser}`).
- List: `GET /api/admin/users`. Delete: `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}`.
- Don't demote the last admin — keep at least one superuser (and/or rely on
  `PRAXYS_ADMIN_EMAIL`).

## Demo accounts

- `POST /api/admin/demo-accounts` (`{email, password}`) — creates a read-mostly
  demo user (used by the public "Try the demo" CTA and perf baselines).

## System announcements

- UI: `/admin/communications` → **System announcements** (site-wide banners; `info`/`warning`/`success`).
- API: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/announcements`; users read active rows from `GET /api/announcements`.
- Bilingual (#355): fill the **Default (English)** fields (the fallback) and,
  optionally, the **中文** fields. Content is stored as an English base plus a
  per-locale `translations` override (`{"zh": {title, body, link_text}}`); a user
  sees `translations[<their locale>]` and falls back to the English base, so a
  `zh` user never gets an English-only banner. Author both language versions
  before publishing to avoid mixed-language banners.

## Feedback triage

In-app bug reports / feature requests land in `/admin/feedback`
(badge shows the count needing attention). The list defaults to **Active**
tickets — use the status filter to view **All** or a single status
(`resolved`, `rejected`, …). During AI triage each ticket is also assigned a
**priority** (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical`), shown as a badge and mirrored
to a `priority: <level>` label only after confirmed publication. Per-row
actions:
- **Approve & queue** — for a new v2-consented, human-reviewed safe draft,
  atomically enqueue metadata; this action never calls GitHub and cannot grant
  or replace the submitter's consent.
- **Re-run triage** — refresh only the analysis and routing result. The action
  grants no publication consent and does not directly create a GitHub issue.
  Feedback that already has current-v2 publication authorization may still
  continue through the normal review and publication gates. A private, legacy,
  or otherwise non-current-v2 submission remains private.
- **Reject** — discard.

`agent-ready` applies only after feedback is linked to an existing public
GitHub issue; it does not turn private feedback into a publication candidate.

Publication results are separate and server-authoritative: `private`,
`queued`, `published`, `manual_required`, `unknown`, or `unavailable`.
`unknown` means do not retry or ask the user to resubmit; the periodic
reconciler must search the exact opaque marker first. Multiple matches require
manual investigation and cannot be approved, rejected, or superseded while
publication evidence remains ambiguous. Account deletion removes the private
feedback but retains detached ambiguity metadata for that investigation. A
legacy v1 row that was never published is private and must be resubmitted
through the v2 form; never edit, migrate, or replay its consent fields.
Already-public legacy issue locators are retained as non-sending publication
evidence without manufacturing v2 consent or a payload digest.

`GET /api/admin/feedback/publication-queue` is the safe operations view. It is
authenticated, `private, no-store`, and contains only row id/time, bounded
status/error, consent validity, issue-link and triage-output presence, and
attempt/reconcile counts. It excludes feedback text/context, user identity,
screenshot keys/descriptions, marker, payload, token, and provider response.

**Sync from GitHub** reconciles each filed ticket with its linked issue: a
closed issue flips the ticket to `resolved`, a reopened one back to
`issue_created`. It also records externally observed `agent-ready` presence and
the state of PRs that close the issue. The GraphQL selection contains only state,
labels, timestamps, PR numbers, and URLs — no ticket/PR text, comments, commits, reviews,
or authors. It is a no-op when GitHub isn't configured; the App needs *Issues:
read/write* plus *Pull requests: read*.

Publication + the sensitivity gate are configured via the GitHub App settings
(`PRAXYS_GITHUB_APP_*` / `PRAXYS_FEEDBACK_GITHUB_*`; see
[config-and-secrets.md](./config-and-secrets.md) and
[setup-github-app.md](./setup-github-app.md)).
To get emailed when something needs review, wire the alert in
[monitoring-and-alerts.md](./monitoring-and-alerts.md).

For an alert, first inspect the metadata-only queue view and runtime readiness.
`config_failure`/`provider_failure` is actionable only when the positive switch
requests service and the emergency stop is clear. `queue_aged` and
`unknown_aged` require outbox/reconciler investigation; do not copy private
feedback into logs. Rollback sets the emergency stop true, stops claims, and
retains the delivery ledger.

> The feedback feature ships in praxys-run/praxys#328; ticket status sync, status
> filtering, and priority suggestions in praxys-run/praxys#359.
