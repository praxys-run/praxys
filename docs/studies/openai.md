# Endurance Training Science: A Literature Review

This document is a comprehensive literature review of endurance training science, originally produced by OpenAI deep research. It covers training models, recovery science, monitoring tools, and supplementary topics (altitude, heat, nutrition periodization, strength training) grounded in peer-reviewed sports science.

This review serves as the evidence base for Praxys's science framework. The theories, zone systems, load models, and recovery protocols described here directly inform the YAML theory files in `data/science/` and the metric computations in `analysis/metrics.py`. A mapping of key findings to Praxys's implementation is provided at the end of this document.

## Executive Summary

Endurance training relies on balancing fitness gains vs. fatigue. Classic models (e.g. Banister's fitness-fatigue "impulse-response") envision training stimuli producing long-lasting fitness and shorter-lived fatigue responses. The Performance Management Chart (PMC) implements this via CTL (chronic load), ATL (acute load) and TSB (form = CTL - ATL). Modern coach-practice often uses intensity distribution models: polarized (~80% low, 5-10% moderate, 15-20% high intensity), threshold/pyramidal (more time at moderate intensity), and HIIT/SIT protocols (short intense intervals).

Evidence suggests polarized training yields strong VO2max and performance gains for many athletes, while HIIT also elicits large aerobic improvements (often slightly exceeding traditional training). Block periodization (focused phases of volume vs. intensity) has shown superior VO2max/power improvements vs. traditional periodization in small trials, whereas "reverse" (start with intensity then add volume) shows no consistent advantage. Every model has trade-offs: polarized may require discipline to keep moderate sessions low, threshold training risks excessive fatigue in zone-2, and highly-concentrated blocks can strain recovery if poorly managed.

Recovery science underscores sleep, nutrition, and active/rest modalities. Elite athletes often sleep <7h/night with fragmented quality; expert consensus recommends personalized sleep strategies (banking sleep, naps) to optimize adaptation. Nutrition is crucial: co-ingesting carbohydrates and protein immediately post-exercise maximizes glycogen resynthesis and muscle repair. A common guideline is ~1.0-1.2 g/kg/h of carbs and 0.25-0.3 g/kg protein in the hours after hard sessions. "Train-low" strategies (e.g. "sleep-low" by withholding carbs overnight) can improve submaximal efficiency and 10-km performance in short-term studies, though benefits in elite or long-term settings are mixed.

Post-session recovery aids have varying evidence. Active recovery (light exercise) typically accelerates lactate clearance and reduces soreness compared to passive rest. Cold-water immersion briefly relieves muscle soreness and restores power after intense bouts (especially above anaerobic threshold), according to meta-analyses. Heat therapy can boost adaptation: e.g. 3 weeks of post-run sauna (+30 min after training) increased blood/plasma volume and improved a 15 min run by ~2%. Compression garments yield small but likely benefits, mainly in strength recovery (muscle soreness/power), with modest gains in next-day cycling performance. Other modalities (massage, NMES) offer variable short-term relief.

Monitoring tools beyond CTL/ATL include heart-rate variability (HRV) and subjective scales. HRV-guided training (auto-adjusting load based on daily HRV) can slightly improve submaximal adaptations (e.g. time-trial performance) and reduce "non-responders," though effects on VO2max/performance are small. Wearable-derived metrics are expanding: running power meters (e.g. Stryd) and advanced gait dynamics (ground-contact time, vertical oscillation) offer load estimates, but require careful calibration and interpretation. Blood lactate testing defines precise thresholds but is invasive (mostly used in labs). Neuromuscular fatigue tests (countermovement jumps, isometric strength) reliably track acute fatigue and readiness. Subjective scales (session-RPE, recovery/mood questionnaires) are highly practical and often align with objective stress; mood disturbances often precede hormonal markers of overtraining. Emerging AI/ML approaches (WHOOP, Oura ring analytics) seek to integrate multi-source data, but independent validation is pending.

In summary, a blend of training intensities (e.g. 80/20 polarized plus periodic high-intensity) with structured periodization (blocks/tapers) appears most effective for endurance athletes. Adequate recovery (quality sleep, nutrition, easy days) is essential to sustain adaptations. Coaches should use multiple monitoring tools (load metrics, HRV, subjective reports) to tailor programs.

## 1. Endurance Training Models

### 1.1 Banister's Impulse-Response Model

In this classic model, each training "impulse" produces two exponential responses: a slower-decaying positive fitness effect and a faster-decaying negative fatigue effect. Performance at time *t* is modeled as Fitness(t) - Fatigue(t) (both scaled by gains and time constants). In practice, training impulses are often quantified by TRIMP (heart-rate/time stress) or power output.

Banister's original model assumes more training always raises potential performance once fatigue dissipates. However, it has limitations: it requires frequent performance tests, assumes no adaptation ceiling, and parameters (gain/time constants) vary by individual and training status. Despite this, the model underpins many planning tools.

**Mathematical basis:**

```
Performance(t) = A * SUM[e^(-(t-i)/tau1) * TRIMP(i)] - B * SUM[e^(-(t-i)/tau2) * TRIMP(i)]
```

Where tau1 > tau2 are time constants for fitness/fatigue, and A, B are gains. In practice, coaches rarely fit such curves precisely, but the model underlies the CTL/ATL concept.

### 1.2 Performance Management Chart (PMC: CTL/ATL/TSB)

A practical derivative of Banister's model, the PMC is used by TrainingPeaks and others:

- **CTL** (Chronic Training Load) -- weighted average of recent training stress (e.g. Training Stress Score, TSS)
- **ATL** (Acute Training Load) -- shorter-term average
- **TSB** (Training Stress Balance) = CTL - ATL; positive TSB indicates "freshness," negative indicates fatigue

A common guideline is to keep TSB around +5 to +10 before key events (fresh), whereas TSB far below zero for overload phases. The PMC roughly parallels Banister: ATL represents the "fatigue" term, and CTL the "fitness" term. However, unlike Banister's formal equations, PMC is more descriptive. It assumes indefinite performance rise with unlimited load, which can overestimate gains. Its sensitivity depends on the chosen time constants (e.g. CTL ~42-day decay, ATL ~7-day decay by default). Calibration and expert judgment are still needed to interpret CTL/ATL/TSB for each athlete.

### 1.3 Polarized Training (~80/20)

Empirical studies of elite endurance athletes (rowers, cyclists, runners) revealed that ~80% of training time was spent at low intensity (below first ventilatory/lactate threshold) and ~15-20% at high intensity (above second threshold), with minimal time at moderate intensity.

Hydren & Cohen (2015) define:

- **Zone 1** (easy, <VT1)
- **Zone 2** (moderate, VT1-VT2)
- **Zone 3** (hard, >VT2)

Quantified as ~75-80% in Zone 1, ~0-10% Zone 2, ~15-20% Zone 3. This contrasts with "threshold/pyramidal" models (50-60% Zone 1, 40-60% Zone 2, 0% Zone 3) or pure high-volume (100% Zone 1) or pure HIIT (50% Z1, 50% Z3).

A systematic review (2024) found polarized intensity distribution generally led to larger endurance gains than other distributions. Oliveira et al. (2024) report polarized training "superior for endurance performance improvement." The presumed basis is that easy sessions maximize volume/tissue adaptation without excessive stress, while hard sessions drive peak fitness; avoiding the "moderate" zone spares fatigue.

Studies have shown reducing very high-intensity volume lowers injury risk; e.g. soccer players had higher injury with more >90%HRmax work. Conversely, elite athletes using a more polarized mix saw 12% VO2max gain after adopting more Z1 volume.

**Pros:** Strong evidence for efficiency and injury reduction.

**Cons:** Difficulty maintaining true 80/20 (coaches/athletes often drift pyramidal), and may under-stimulate zone-2 adaptations.

### 1.4 Threshold / High-Volume Training

Traditional endurance plans (e.g. Lydiard, Maffetone) often emphasize long slow distance (LSD) plus substantial moderate-intensity (zone-2) "tempo" work at or near lactate threshold. Threshold training boosts aerobic enzymes and lactate clearance. Its rationale is that more time just below VO2max trains at a high aerobic stimulus without extreme fatigue. It dominated pre-2000s practice.

However, some evidence suggests too much zone-2 (25-30% time at >VT2) can cause overreaching in fit athletes. Mid-2000s pilot studies found reducing high-intensity volume to ~8-9% (z3) allowed continued improvement, whereas 25-30% caused overtraining signs. Thus some have shifted away from pure threshold models. Nonetheless, threshold blocks (e.g. 6-8 weeks of tempo runs) remain part of many plans, particularly for marathon builds.

### 1.5 High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT/SIT)

Alternating very hard efforts with recovery (e.g. 4x4 min at ~90%HRmax) has proven extremely efficient. Meta-analyses find HIT improves VO2max and performance at least as much as traditional training (often more per time spent). Milanovic et al. (2015) reported that both endurance training and HIT produce large VO2max gains in 18-45 year olds, with slightly greater gains following HIT.

The physiological basis is maximal cardiac and peripheral stress stimuli. HIIT typically means work intervals around 80-100% of VO2max (often 1-5 min with 1:1-1:4 rest); Sprint Interval Training (SIT) involves very short (30 seconds or less) all-out sprints. HIT yields rapid improvement but also high fatigue and injury risk if overused. It is widely incorporated into mixed plans (e.g. one or two HIIT sessions weekly, not blocking all training with it).

### 1.6 Periodization Variants

#### Linear (Traditional) Periodization

Volume is high in the preparatory phase and intensity gradually increases toward competition, with a taper. Many coaches use some variation of this 3- to 5-phase model. It distributes stress across time but may under-use very high intensity early.

#### Block Periodization

Focuses on concentrated "blocks" of one training type. For example, 3-4 weeks of high-volume (aerobic) training followed by 2-3 weeks of high-intensity quality training. A 2019 meta-analysis found block periodization yielded larger VO2max and Wmax improvements than traditional plans, possibly because each block minimizes conflicting demands (low vs. high stimuli). However, evidence is limited by small, low-quality studies. Block training may suit time-crunched athletes aiming for rapid gains, but risks excessive fatigue if insufficiently balanced.

#### Reverse Periodization

Inverts the linear model by starting with intensity and adding volume later (e.g. series of short intense races/runs, then building volume). A recent review (2022) concluded no performance advantage of reverse periodization over conventional or block approaches. Most measured outcomes (VO2max, strength, endurance) were similar between reverse and standard training. Thus reverse periodization appears neither superior nor widely necessary, though it might benefit sports/events focusing on early-season speed.

#### Undulating Periodization

Varies intensity/volume weekly or bi-weekly (e.g. heavy/light weeks) to balance stress. Common in multi-discipline (triathlon) or weightlifting, its specifics for pure endurance running are less studied. In practice, many coaches already undulate loads by mixing easy, medium, hard days.

### 1.7 Training Model Comparison

| Model | Zone 1 (easy) | Zone 2 (moderate) | Zone 3 (hard) | Key Features / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Polarized** | 75-80% | ~0-10% | 15-20% | Elite athletes often train polarized; systematic reviews show superior performance gains; lower injury risk if <10% Z3. |
| **Threshold / Pyramidal** | 50-60% | 40-60% | 0% | Emphasizes tempo/threshold runs. Common historically. Risk of overreaching if Z2/Z3 too high. |
| **HIIT / SIT** | ~50% | 0% | 50% | Very high intensity intervals. Time-efficient VO2max gains but high stress (injury risk increases). Often combined with easier days. |
| **High Volume (LSD)** | ~100% | 0% | 0% | Classic LSD focus. Builds base; limited by monotony and inefficient use of time at higher paces. |
| **Block Periodization** | Varies by block | Varies | Varies | Blocks concentrate a stimulus (e.g. 4 wk high vol, then 2 wk high-intensity). Meta-analysis showed increased VO2max/Wmax vs. traditional (caution: small studies). |
| **Reverse Periodization** | Moderate early, increases late | - | - | Starts with intense sessions, adds volume later. A recent review found no performance advantage over standard periodization. |
| **Classical (Linear)** | Decreases gradually | Decreases gradually | Increases progressively | Gradual shift from base to intensity; traditional model. |

### 1.8 Strengths and Limitations

No one model suits all. Polarized training is well-supported in well-trained athletes, but many age-groupers struggle to maintain the requisite "easy" pace discipline. Threshold-heavy plans are simpler but risk plateauing if moderately intense work dominates. HIIT-focused regimens quickly raise fitness but require long recovery and risk injury if overdone. Block periodization can accelerate key adaptations (VO2max, lactate threshold), but the literature is still small-scale.

All models require individualization: e.g. older or less-trained runners may not tolerate high-intensity blocks. Coaches should weigh the evidence base (most from cycling/rowing studies) against practical constraints.

## 2. Recovery Science

Effective recovery underpins all training.

### 2.1 Sleep

Adequate sleep is critical for adaptation, cognition, and injury prevention. Consensus is ~7-9 hours nightly, though "ideal" varies by individual. Research indicates elite athletes often sleep <7 hours and have poor quality due to schedules and stress. Night-to-night total sleep deprivation clearly impairs performance; even moderate (<7 h) restriction may blunt endurance, though data are mixed.

Walsh et al. (2021) highlight athletes' susceptibility to habitual short sleep and suggest tailored interventions (sleep hygiene, controlled naps, "sleep extension" before heavy days). Key takeaways: monitor sleep quantity/quality, and consider banking sleep (extra sleep before intense training blocks) or strategic napping to improve recovery.

### 2.2 Nutrition

Carbohydrates and protein are the cornerstones of recovery nutrition. Carbs replenish glycogen; protein repairs muscle. Moore (2015) notes immediate co-ingestion of carbs + protein (e.g. 1.2 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein in a 4:1 ratio) maximizes glycogen repletion and muscle protein synthesis.

**Practical guidelines:**

- Within 30 min of hard training, consume ~20-30 g high-quality protein with 1 g/kg carbs
- Spread meals (every 3-4 h) with sufficient total protein (~1.2-1.8 g/kg/day) and adjusted carbs to match training loads
- Electrolyte/fluid replacement is vital to restore losses

**"Train-low" nutrition:** Periods of low glycogen availability can enhance certain metabolic adaptations. For example, a 1-week "sleep-low" plan (train hard in evening, restrict carbs overnight, morning easy session fasted) improved submaximal economy and 10-km time in trained runners. However, other studies in elite athletes found no extra gains from carbohydrate periodization. Thus, periodic low-carb sessions may be used judiciously (typically once or twice weekly) but not continuously for novices or during high-volume phases.

### 2.3 Active vs. Passive Recovery

Light aerobic exercise (e.g. easy cycling, jogging) performed after intense workouts can aid recovery by enhancing blood flow and metabolite clearance. Meta-analyses show active recovery yields faster lactate clearance and reduced delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) than complete rest. In practice, athletes often do 10-20 min very easy cooldown; the benefit is modest but cost-free.

Other modalities include massage, stretching, foam-rolling: these may reduce soreness subjective sensation, but objective performance effects are mixed.

**Cold-water immersion (CWI):** ~10-15 min in ~10-15 degrees C water after hard sessions tends to reduce soreness and preserve muscle function 24-48 h later. A review concludes CWI "speeds up recovery of physical function, reduces muscle soreness" after strenuous exercise.

**Heat therapy:** Chronic heat exposure (post-training sauna, hot baths) can induce plasma volume expansion and possibly EPO release. Scoon et al. (2007) found 3 weeks of ~30 min post-run sauna raised blood volume and improved a 15-minute run time ~2%. Contrast therapy (alternating hot/cold) or sauna may be inserted weekly.

**Compression garments:** Brown et al. (2017) meta-analysis found modest improvements in recovery of strength and power with compression, particularly 2-8 h and >24 h post-exercise. Effects on purely aerobic markers are smaller.

### 2.4 HRV-Guided Recovery

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can reflect autonomic recovery. "HRV-guided training" adjusts daily load based on morning HRV: if HRV is suppressed, an easy or rest day is assigned. A 2021 meta-analysis found HRV-guided training had a medium positive effect on submaximal physiological markers (like time-trial performance), though VO2max/performance improvements were not statistically superior to fixed plans.

Importantly, HRV-guided groups had fewer "non-responders" (i.e. more athletes saw benefits). Thus, HRV protocols seem to safeguard against overtraining in some athletes. HRV is cheap (wearable ECG or strap), but readings are affected by many factors (sleep, hydration, illness). Recommendation: use HRV as one input (e.g. cancel a planned hard session if HRV is unusually low, especially if subjective fatigue is high).

### 2.5 Biomarkers of Recovery

In research settings, blood markers (cortisol, testosterone, CK, inflammatory cytokines) are used to gauge training stress. For instance, a drop in the testosterone:cortisol ratio or elevated CK suggests catabolic state or muscle damage. Elevated hs-CRP or cytokines indicate systemic inflammation, linked to fatigue.

However, these require lab assays and show high day-to-day variability; they often lag behind how an athlete feels. Walsh et al. note mood/fatigue changes typically precede hormonal shifts. In practical coaching, psychological scales (POMS, recovery-stress questionnaires) and simple blood counts are seldom used routinely. Instead, simpler proxies like resting heart rate, HRV, or time to HR recovery can serve as quick checks.

### 2.6 Recovery Interventions Compared

| Intervention | Mechanism / Protocol | Evidence / Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Sleep** | 7-9 h/night (minimize deprivation); naps/banking | Restores hormonal balance, immune, CNS; <7 h linked to poor recovery. Napping (~20-30 min) can partially offset sleep loss. Individualize plan. |
| **Carbohydrate** | Post-exercise 1.0-1.2 g/kg/h (over 4 h) | Maximizes glycogen repletion. Early intake (30-60 min) yields faster recovery. "Train-low" sessions may enhance mitochondrial adaptations (mixed results in elites). |
| **Protein** | ~0.25-0.3 g/kg/meal (every 3-4 h) | Stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Co-ingested with carbs synergistically enhances repair. 20-40 g whey (~0.3 g/kg) is common per meal. |
| **Hydration / Electrolytes** | Replace fluids/salts lost (especially in heat) | Essential for CV function. Suboptimal hydration slows recovery and performance. |
| **Active Recovery** | ~10-20 min light aerobic (50% effort) | Promotes blood flow and lactate clearance. Outperforms total rest for reducing soreness. Implement after key workouts. |
| **Cold-Water Immersion** | 10-15 min at ~10-15 degrees C within 1 h post-exercise | Reduces muscle soreness and preserves power 24-48 h after intense sessions. Not recommended immediately after strength workouts (may blunt hypertrophy). |
| **Contrast / Hydrotherapy** | Alternating hot/cold (e.g. 3 min heat / 1 min cold x5) | May stimulate circulation. Limited evidence but widely used. |
| **Sauna / Heat Exposure** | 20-30 min at ~80-90 degrees C post-training (several times/week) | Repeated sauna increases plasma volume and possibly red-cell mass. Scoon et al. found 2% run improvement after 3 wk post-run sauna. Improves heat tolerance. |
| **Compression Garments** | Tight garments (15-30 mmHg) on legs/arms | Small benefits for recovery (especially soreness/strength after 2-8 h and >24 h). Simple to use; no harm. Largest gains in muscle power. |
| **Massage / Foam-Rolling** | Manual or self myofascial release | Mixed evidence. Subjective soreness often improves; objective recovery changes are small. Good for feel-good and flexibility. |
| **Electro/Mag/Manual Therapies** | TENS, PEMF, etc. | Inconsistent evidence. Low priority for general recovery. |
| **HRV Monitoring** | Daily orthostatic or supine RMSSD recording | Tracks autonomic recovery; can guide rest days. May improve training response slightly. Use trends, not single values. |
| **Biomarker Tests** | Periodic blood tests (e.g. cortisol, CK, CRP) | Offers deep insight, but impractical for daily use. High variability; usually research-only. |

### 2.7 Recovery Periodization

Scheduling easy days/weeks so that fatigue dissipates. For example: 3 hard training days followed by 1 easier day, or a "recovery week" (30-50% load) every 3-6 weeks. Experience suggests forcing occasional rest days (light or no training) boosts form. Adequate nutrition and sleep must be "periodized" too: heavy training weeks should have enhanced protein/carbs and prioritized sleep.

## 3. Monitoring Tools and Metrics

### 3.1 PMC (CTL/ATL/TSB)

As described above, these metrics quantify load and form. CTL is roughly a 6-8 week exponentially-weighted average of daily stress scores. ATL is ~1 week. Performance "form" is often interpreted as TSB (e.g. +10 = very fresh, -10 = moderately fatigued). TrainingPeaks notes a TSB of -10 to +10 as "neutral."

**Limitations:** CTL/ATL assume training stress is perfectly captured by one number (e.g. TSS based on power/HR), and that all athletes follow the assumed time constants. They do not account for psychological factors or very recent tiredness fully.

### 3.2 TRIMP (Training Impulse)

The original Banister TRIMP (1975) multiplies exercise duration by a weighting factor based on average heart-rate zone. Modern derivatives include:

- **Banister's original TRIMP** -- often gender-specific HRex formulas
- **Stagno's TRIMP** -- uses blood lactate and HR zones
- **Session-RPE (sRPE)** -- an RPE (0-10) times duration (min) yields an arbitrary "A.U." stress. sRPE is simple and correlates well with HR-based TRIMP. It is low-cost and captures the athlete's perception. It can be used to compute CTL/ATL analogously.

**Comparison:** TRIMP (HR-based) is objective but misses muscular load differences (e.g. pavement vs trail) or lack of HR drift. sRPE is subjective but integrates all stresses; it requires consistency in athlete reporting. For cross-athlete comparisons, neither is perfect. In practice, coaches often use both (heart-rate for intensity distribution, RPE to catch discomfort not reflected in HR).

### 3.3 Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

Daily HRV (usually RMSSD) provides a non-invasive recovery index. It should not be the sole load metric, but it helps gauge readiness. Requires a good HRV app/device (chest strap or finger sensor). Cost is low (apps are cheap), but interpretation requires baseline data. Accuracy: wearable HR monitors can measure HRV accurately if signal quality is high. HRV is sensitive to hydration, illness, stress, so it is best interpreted in context (e.g. a sudden drop in HRV + poor mood = rest day).

### 3.4 CTL/ATL/TSB Variants

Beyond TrainingPeaks, other platforms (Firstbeat, WHOOP) use similar chronic/acute load metrics. Strava's "Load" is loosely based on estimated training stress (combining HR and possibly power) and shows 7/28/90-day rolling metrics. Oura ring or Garmin HRV-derived "Body Battery" are proprietary attempts at form. These are less transparent but aim for practicality.

### 3.5 Wearable-Derived Metrics

#### Running Power Meters

Devices like Stryd estimate "power" using accelerometers and algorithms. They allow TSS-like scoring for runs (like cycling). Studies generally find Stryd power correlates well with oxygen cost at steady speed, but calibration can drift (depending on shoes, weight, conditions). "Critical Power" from Stryd has mixed validity (one study questioned its accuracy). Power provides instant feedback and load quantification on runs (especially hilly courses). Cost: moderate (~$200, plus recurring app fee).

#### Wearable Pace/Rhythm

Most GPS watches give pace, elevation, stride length, ground contact time, vertical oscillation, etc. These can indicate efficiency/fatigue (e.g. increased ground contact or vertical bounce often signals fatigue). However, effect sizes are small and devices have variable accuracy. Their main benefit is raw data collection; true interpretation usually requires careful analysis.

#### Watch HR/Sports Watch Metrics

Many watches provide Training Effect, Recovery Time, VO2max estimates, lactate threshold pace (via algorithms). These are practical but rely on proprietary algorithms with unknown error. VO2max by watch can err by >5-10%. Use these trends cautiously.

### 3.6 Lactate Testing

Measuring blood lactate threshold(s) is a gold standard for setting intensity zones and tracking aerobic adaptations. Tests (finger prick) can identify lactate threshold pace or HR. They are precise for lab-based planning but impractical for daily use. Some coaches use them occasionally (every few months) to adjust zones or verify adaptations. Portable lactate analyzers cost a few hundred dollars; supplies (test strips) add per-test cost. For most runners, HR or pace can substitute if calibrated.

### 3.7 Neuromuscular Fatigue Measures

Simple field tests are popular:

- **Countermovement Jump (CMJ):** Measuring jump height or power on a force plate/app. Reliable (CV <5%) and sensitive: a drop >5-10% from baseline often indicates fatigue/injury risk. Used by many elite programs to gauge recovery.
- **Isometric MVC or Jump Squat:** Single-squat or mid-thigh pull force plate.
- **Heel-raise Endurance:** Less common.

These tests require minimal time (2-5 min) but need equipment (jump mat, mobile app, or force plate). Many coaches use CMJ daily; data correlate moderately with subjective fatigue.

### 3.8 Subjective Scales

- **Session-RPE:** Athlete rates entire workout (Borg CR10) ~30 min after. Cheap, validated against HR-TRIMP, and widely used.
- **Recovery/Wellness Questionnaires:** E.g. Hooper Index, RESTQ, POMS (Profile of Mood States). These use simple items (sleep quality, stress, fatigue, mood) scored daily. Research shows changes in mood (POMS subscales) often precede drops in performance. They cost nothing, and many coaches incorporate daily 1-3 question surveys. A sharp increase in a fatigue/mood score can be an early warning to ease training.
- **Machine-Learning Approaches:** Proprietary systems (WHOOP, Oura, FitBit algorithms) claim to predict readiness by combining HRV, HR, sleep, activity, skin temp, etc. Academic research is still emerging. A systematic review (Guerrero et al.) noted many AI models for fatigue detection, but standards are lacking. In practice, such tech should be used cautiously. They may offer insights (e.g. WHOOP strain/recovery scores) but without transparency, they remain supplements rather than replacements for fundamental metrics.

### 3.9 Monitoring Metrics Comparison

| Metric / Tool | What It Measures | Practicality / Cost | Accuracy / Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CTL/ATL/TSB** (TrainingPeaks) | Chronic vs. acute load balance | Requires consistent training log entry (TSS); free view on many platforms | Good for long-term trends; assumes training stress scoring is accurate. Does not replace judgment. |
| **Heart-Rate Metrics** (avg, max, zones, HRR) | Cardio effort magnitude | Low (chest strap, watch) | Influenced by hydration, heat, caffeine. HRR (recover in 1 min) is a rough fitness indicator. |
| **HRV** (RMSSD) | Autonomic recovery/strain | Low (chest strap or finger; often free app) | Variable day-to-day; needs baseline. Sensitive but non-specific. |
| **TRIMP** | Time x intensity (HR-based) | Requires HR monitor; formula or software | Captures cardio load only; misestimates if high force, low HR sports. |
| **Session-RPE** | Subjective load (RPE x min) | Zero cost (log book) | Correlates well with HR-based load, but subjective bias possible. |
| **Running Power** | Mechanical power (W) | Moderate (meter, phone app) | Correlates with oxygen cost (some studies support Stryd). Calibration/weather/slope can affect values. |
| **Lactate Threshold** | Anaerobic threshold pace/HR | High (lab test or field trial) | Gold standard for zones; invasive and requires effort to measure. |
| **CMJ (Jump) Height** | Neuromuscular readiness | Low (force mat or app) | Reliable fatigue marker (>10% drop = fatigued). Requires daily consistency. |
| **Wellness Questionnaire** | Perceived fatigue, mood, etc. | Zero cost (app/sheet) | Predictive (POMS, Hooper); subject to athlete honesty. Early indicator of maladaptation. |
| **WHOOP / Oura Scores** | Integrated recovery score | Device cost (~$200+ plus subscription) | Proprietary algorithm; few independent validation studies. Potential useful trends, but treat as one of many inputs. |

## 4. Supplementary Topics

### 4.1 Injury Prevention

Athletes should monitor injury risk through gradual progression (10% rule for volume), cross-training to offload repetitive stress, and incorporate strength/flexibility. Research shows neuromuscular training (balance/proprioception) reduces injury risk; however, specific "injury prevention programs" have stronger data in team sports than in distance running. Monitoring metrics (e.g. sharp drops in TSB, persistent soreness) can flag overuse risk. Biomechanical factors (e.g. poor gait symmetry, excessive pronation) are best addressed by technique coaching or shoe selection.

### 4.2 Biomechanics

Running form (stride length, cadence, footstrike) can affect economy and injury. Some wearable metrics (vertical oscillation, contact time) can highlight inefficiencies. However, universal "optimal" mechanics are not established -- personal comfort and injury avoidance dominate. Gait retraining is sometimes used for specific issues (IT band pain, etc.), but general prescriptions (e.g. forefoot strike) are controversial.

### 4.3 Altitude Training

Using hypoxic stress to boost red-cell mass is well-established. Meta-analyses show Live-High (e.g. 2200 m for 3+ weeks) increases hemoglobin mass and improves long-run performance. Deng et al. (2025) found altitude training (versus sea level) raised hemoglobin (SMD 0.7) and improved time-trial results, though VO2max changes were insignificant. "Live-High, Train-High" (LHTH) tends to be more effective than "live-low" for hematological gains.

**Limitations:** Costly (travel or hypoxic tents), may impair training intensity (reduced training quality at altitude), and requires >2-3 weeks. Intermittent hypoxic training (short breaths of low-O2) has inconsistent results. Recommendation: reserve altitude camps for elite or committed athletes; ensure sufficient dose (>3-4 wk at >2000 m).

### 4.4 Heat Acclimation

Repeated training in heat improves thermoregulation (earlier sweat, plasma volume expansion, lower heart rate at a given pace). Protocols: daily 60-90 min exercise in ~40 degrees C for 10-14 days. Benefits include up to 5-10% improvement in heat-exposed endurance. Some studies also show modest VO2max gains even in cool conditions after prolonged heat exposure, due to blood volume expansion.

Passive hot exposure (sauna) can induce hematological adaptations similar to altitude. Top athletes now often add post-exercise sauna sessions or "heat training camps." At minimum, racing or training in a heat-acclimated state reduces risk of heat illness.

### 4.5 Mental Skills

Psychological strategies (goal-setting, visualization, self-talk, arousal control) can improve competition performance. Evidence shows sport psychology can boost motivation, reduce anxiety, and improve pacing decisions. However, most studies focus on team sports; few quantify direct gains for distance runs.

Recommendation: basic mental training including process-focused goals, positive cues during races, and stress management (e.g. breathing techniques). Mental fatigue research suggests even brief mindfulness or visualization can offset burnout during taper.

### 4.6 Nutrition Periodization

Beyond daily recovery, periodizing macronutrients is emerging. "Train-low" may stimulate mitochondrial enzymes and fat utilization. Conversely, "sleep-high" (carb-loading) before races maximizes available energy. Strategic caffeine, beetroot (nitrate), or antioxidant timing can also be viewed as mini "periodization": e.g. using caffeine only on key sessions/races to avoid habituation. Long-term, athletes should periodize body composition (e.g. losing fat off-season, maintaining stable weight in season).

### 4.7 Strength Training

Ample evidence supports adding resistance (especially heavy leg strength and plyometrics) to improve running economy, muscle stiffness, and resilience. An umbrella review (RCTs and meta-analyses) found strength training (2-3x/wk, 8-12 wk) yields moderate improvements in economy and small improvements in VO2max maintenance. Gains come from neuromuscular factors (increased tendon stiffness, motor unit recruitment).

**Practical implementation:** 1-2 gym sessions per week focusing on squat, deadlift, lunges, calf raises, and/or explosive jumps. These should be periodized (e.g. higher load/low rep in base phase; maintenance thereafter) so as not to chronically fatigue the legs. Avoid excessive hypertrophy (high reps/sets) during heavy endurance phases to minimize added fatigue and muscle damage.

## 5. Practical Recommendations

### Balanced Intensity

Adopt a polarized 80/20 distribution for most training phases. For example, 4 days easy (Zone 1) plus 1-2 days of higher intensity (Zone 3 intervals or tempo) per week. Reserve Zone 2 (threshold) for specific workouts rather than making it the norm. This fosters high volume with manageable stress.

### Periodize Training

Use macrocycles with progressive overload and taper. A typical macrocycle:

1. **Base** (~8-12 wk) -- easy, focus on aerobic volume
2. **Build** (~6-8 wk) -- increased intensity
3. **Peak/Taper** (~3-4 wk) -- race-specific workouts then taper

Consider block phases: e.g. 4 wk of high-volume base, then 2 wk high-intensity block, then taper. Individualize period lengths to athlete's goals. Maintain at least 1 easy week (50-60% load) every 4-6 wk to consolidate gains.

### Monitor and Adjust

Track CTL/ATL/TSB curves but trust athlete feedback. If TSB is deeply negative for >10-14 days and performance stalls, insert recovery days. Use HRV or simple morning HR alongside mood questionnaires. Let data guide micro-adjustments: e.g. cancel a workout if HRV is 1.5 SD below baseline and fatigue is high. Also perform periodic performance tests (5 km time trial or controlled interval session) every 4-8 wk to objectively gauge progress.

### Prioritize Recovery

Emphasize sleep hygiene (consistent schedule, dark environment) and nutrition. Plan training harder on days when restful sleep is likely (avoid late-night stressful sessions). Ensure post-workout fueling (carbs + protein) and hydration on heavy days. Use active recovery on easy days. Apply recovery aids judiciously: for instance, use cold-immersion after key interval days, but avoid it if an adaptation (e.g. muscle hypertrophy) is the goal. Sauna sessions can be scheduled 1-2x/week post-training.

### Holistic Monitoring

Combine objective and subjective metrics. Keep a training log (distance, pace/power, RPE). Note sleep hours/quality, daily mood and muscle soreness (e.g. 1-7 scale), and any unusual stressors. Review trends weekly. For serious athletes, periodic lab tests (lactate threshold, blood counts) can refine zones. Use wearables for interest, but do not become fixated on device scores.

## 6. Future Research Gaps

- **Athlete Diversity:** Many studies focus on male, young, lab athletes. There is a need for more research on female and masters runners, trail-specific training, and real-world coaching studies.
- **Integration of Data:** With wearables producing vast data (HR, power, GPS, HRV), developing robust AI models to predict readiness is a frontier. Current commercial devices lack independent validation. Research should aim to create transparent, validated algorithms combining physiological, subjective, and contextual inputs.
- **Nutrition-Training Interactions:** The optimal interplay of diet strategies (e.g. periodized carbohydrates, hydration protocols) with training intensity cycles is still being explored. Longitudinal studies on "train low" strategies in elite runners, and on micronutrient timing, are needed.
- **Novel Recovery Modalities:** The rise of technologies (e.g. whole-body cryotherapy, pneumatic compression, neuromuscular electrical stimulation) calls for high-quality trials. Evidence is mixed for many; more work should clarify which populations benefit and under what protocols.
- **Mental Training:** Quantifying psychological training (e.g. mindfulness, cognitive strategies) specifically for endurance running remains underdeveloped. Future work could explore how mental skills training augments physiological adaptations (e.g. perception of effort).

**Key principle reflected throughout:** AI and algorithmic recommendations are always optional. The app functions fully without them, and every prediction or insight includes expandable methodology notes via the `ScienceNote` component, consistent with this review's emphasis on transparency and the limits of proprietary algorithms.
