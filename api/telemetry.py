"""Application Insights telemetry helpers — lazy, no-op when unconfigured.

Three Coach-tier signals power the operator dashboard for issue #221:

- ``record_coach_tokens(insight_type, model, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens)``
  emits an OpenTelemetry counter ``praxys.coach_tokens`` so daily token spend
  by ``insight_type`` is queryable in ``customMetrics``.
- ``record_coach_run(insight_type, status, user_id)`` emits a counter
  ``praxys.coach_run`` (or a customEvent when the events extension is
  installed) so cache hit rate is derivable from ``status`` over time. The
  raw user id is hashed before emission — telemetry is not a PII surface.
- ``record_coach_error(error_class)`` emits ``praxys.coach_error`` so a
  sustained spike in operator-actionable error classes (Auth, BadRequest)
  pages oncall.

Why a counter for coach_run / coach_error instead of a customEvent: the
``azure-monitor-events-extension`` package is the canonical customEvent
emitter, but it is not pulled in by ``azure-monitor-opentelemetry`` — and
the issue forbids new dependencies. We therefore opportunistically use it
when present and fall back to a counter (which lands in customMetrics)
otherwise. The KQL queries documented on the issue translate directly:
``count(status==X)`` becomes ``sum(value) where status==X`` because each
record contributes value=1.

Lazy / no-op contract: every helper short-circuits silently when the
``APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`` env var is unset (same signal
``api/main.py`` uses to skip ``configure_azure_monitor``) or when the OTel
meter API isn't importable — sync hooks must never break because telemetry
is misconfigured.
