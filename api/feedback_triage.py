"""Background triage for user feedback: scrub → classify → publish.

Pipeline (runs as a FastAPI ``BackgroundTask`` after the submit returns):

1. Load the :class:`db.models.Feedback` row in its *own* DB session — the
   request session is closed by the time a background task runs. (Same
   transaction-ownership pattern as :mod:`api.insights_runner`.)
2. Deterministically scrub the raw message + context (:mod:`api.feedback_scrub`).
3. If Azure OpenAI is configured, ask the model to turn the scrubbed report
   into a clean issue title + structured markdown body and to confirm the
   ``kind``. The model only ever sees already-scrubbed text. When the model
   is unavailable, a deterministic rule-based title/body is used instead.
4. Run the final title + body through the scrubber *again* (we never trust the
   model as the sole redactor for a public repo).
5. If GitHub is configured, open an issue (labeled so an agent can pick it up)
   and record the number/url. Otherwise leave the row ``triaged`` for an admin
   to promote from the Admin page.

Nothing here raises: a failure marks the row ``failed`` with a short error and
returns. The submit endpoint already returned 200 to the user.
