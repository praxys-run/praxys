"""HTTP ETag / 304-revalidation for the dashboard endpoints (issue #147).

After L1 (#146) split ``get_dashboard_data`` into per-endpoint packs, each
pack reads a known subset of tables. L2 turns that into an HTTP-cache win:
warm visits skip the full response-body re-send when no relevant data has
changed since the client's last visit.

How it composes:

  1. Sync writers and config-mutation routes call
     ``db.cache_revision.bump_revisions`` after their commit, advancing a
     monotonic counter for each affected scope.
  2. Each route declares which scopes its packs read via
     ``ENDPOINT_SCOPES`` and depends on ``etag_guard_for_scopes(...)``.
  3. The dependency hashes the user_id + per-scope revisions into a short
     ETag. If the request's ``If-None-Match`` matches, the route returns
     304 with no body. Otherwise the route serves the full payload with
     ``ETag`` + ``Cache-Control: private, must-revalidate, max-age=0`` so
     the browser revalidates next visit (instead of serving stale).

The hash is cheap — one indexed SELECT against ``cache_revisions`` (PK is
``(user_id, scope)``), then ``blake2b(digest_size=8)``. p95 well under the
50 ms target on the existing DB size.
