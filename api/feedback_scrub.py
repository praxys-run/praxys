"""Deterministic PII / secret scrubbing for user-submitted feedback.

This repo is public, so anything that may end up in a GitHub issue must be
sanitized first. The LLM triage step (:mod:`api.feedback_triage`) rewrites
feedback into a clean title/body, but we do *not* trust the model to be a
reliable redactor — so every string published externally also passes through
the regex scrub here as a deterministic backstop. When the LLM is unavailable,
this scrub is the *only* sanitizer, so it is intentionally conservative.

All functions are pure (no I/O, no global state) and unit-tested in
``tests/test_feedback.py``. Patterns are deliberately broad: a false-positive
redaction (over-scrubbing) is acceptable; leaking a real secret is not.
