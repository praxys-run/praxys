"""Derive Critical Power from activity power observations.

Fits the canonical 2-parameter hyperbolic CP model (Monod & Scherrer 1965,
Jones et al. 2010) to the user's own best-effort power-vs-duration points:

    P(t) = CP + W' / t

where ``CP`` (watts) is the asymptote — the highest power sustainable for
theoretically indefinite duration — and ``W'`` (joules) is the finite work
capacity above CP. The fit is a linear regression after reparametrising
``P`` against ``1/t``: slope = W', intercept = CP.

**Why this exists.** The app already accepts CP values written by each
connected source (Stryd's Power Center, Garmin's ``functionalThresholdPower``
endpoint). For a user running Stryd via Connect-IQ on Garmin but without a
direct Stryd account, explicitly named per-split ConnectIQ power can carry
Stryd provenance while the only CP source available is Garmin's native FTP
estimate from a different power pipeline. Treating unverified pipelines as
compatible produces wrong load, race predictions, and training targets.

Activity-derived CP only consumes split power with explicit provider
provenance, so its provider remains inspectable and can be matched to workload.

**Important caveat — not an all-out test.** In the laboratory CP protocol
each predicting point is a *separate maximal effort* at a fixed duration.
We do not have that. We have whatever the user happened to run — laps
inside a workout, tempo efforts, pacing-limited time trials. A 5-minute
hard split inside a longer run is not equivalent to an all-out 5-minute
time trial, and the resulting CP estimate tends to be **biased low**. The
number is useful as a self-consistent counterpart to the power data the
activities actually carry; it is not a substitute for a controlled test.

**Model choice.** We use the 2-parameter hyperbolic because it has the
best data-to-parameter ratio for our typical 3-4 in-window points and a
closed-form linear-regression solution. The 3-parameter Morton (1996)
extension adds a ``P_max`` term but requires short-duration data we don't
reliably have; the linear work-vs-time form ``W = CP·t + W'`` is
numerically equivalent but emphasises long-duration leverage where our
data is thinnest. 2-parameter is the right v1 for this use case.

**Data constraints.** We use per-split (lap) averages rather than unprovenanced
activity summaries or per-second power streams. The finest resolution for
"best power over N seconds" is therefore the shortest lap the user recorded.
Typical lap durations fall between ~90 s (400 m repeats) and ~300 s (1 km
splits). We bin candidate points by duration and keep the peak power per bin to
approximate the mean-maximal power curve.
